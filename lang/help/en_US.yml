  canvas: Defaults to Pixelcanvas.io.
  diff: "Images must be in PNG format.\nError pixels will be marked in red. Pixels that do not match the canvas palette ('bad color') will be marked in blue (see `{p}help quantize`).\nYou cannot zoom an image to contain more than 4 million pixels."
  dither:
    "Images must be in PNG or JPEG format.\nThe image will be converted to the palette you select using the dithering algorithm specified.\nPlease be aware that the algorthims other than Bayer dithering can be quite slow, you may need to wait a while.\nThe dimension limits on each algorithm are as follows:\nBayer dithering: 1500px by 1500px\nYliluoma dithering: 100px by 100px\nFloyd Steinberg dithering: 100px by 100px\n \nBayer dithering: `[-b|--bayer] <threshold> <order>`\nYliluoma dithering: `[-y|--yliluoma] <order>`\nFloyd Steinberg dithering: `[-f|-fs|--floyd-steinberg] <order>`\n \nThreshold can be either: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 or 512\nOrder can be either: 2, 4, 8 or 16"

  register: "Opting into this feature means that whenever you type :animated_emoji_name: I will delete your message and replace it with the emoji specified, as long as that emoji is in a server that I can see.\n \nYou only need to register once for this to apply to all guilds.\nThis feature requires that I have the Manage Messages permission."

If the image is not quantized to the target canvas's palette, I will offer to quantize it for you.\nA guild can have up to 25 templates at any time.\nTemplates must have unique names (max 32 chars, case sensitive). If you attempt to add a new template with the same name as an existing one, it will be replaced if you have permission to remove the old one (see `{p}help remove`).\nI only store URLs to templates. If the message that originally uploaded a template is deleted, its URL will break and the template will be lost. Save backups to your computer just in case."
