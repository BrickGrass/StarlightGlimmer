Welcome to Starlight Glimmer's documentation!
=============================================

When documenting command signatures I have used the following rules:

1. Arguments within <>'s are required for the command to run
2. Arguments within ()'s are optional, you can include them, but the command will run without them
3. In any case where there is more than one group of required arguments for a single command, I have listed out each of these groups with the optional arguments that work with them
